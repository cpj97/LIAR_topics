# LIAR_topics

As social media becomes deeply ingrained in everyday life, it has dramatically increased the speed and ease of information sharing. Unfortunately, this largely unmonitored environment also makes it easier for false or deliberately misleading content (fake news) to spread rapidly. Given the overwhelming volume of posts and the hard possibility of manual check, researchers have turned to automated fake news detection techniques as a vital tool to control misinformation and mitigate its harmful societal impact. Although these new techniques have been recently developed, further analysis on specific topics related to such type of news needs to be developed. For that reason, this paper implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for topic modeling on the LIAR dataset developed by [Wang (2017)](https://aclanthology.org/P17-2067/) to detect which topics are more prone to be associated with fake news. In this regard, the model shows that news related to topics such as Barack Obama (presidential term), healthcare, Trump vs. Clinton presidential campaign, and electoral campaigns are more susceptible to misinformation.
